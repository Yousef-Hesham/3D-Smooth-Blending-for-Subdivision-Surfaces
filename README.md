# 3D-Smooth-Blending-for-Subdivision-Surfaces
This project is designed to load and view 3D freeform meshes, then apply subdivision technique to obtain a finer/smoother mesh using Catmull-Clark subdivision scheme. As well as being able to blend these freeform object meshes together while maintaining the overall smoothness of the object.
